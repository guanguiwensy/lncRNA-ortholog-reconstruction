# lncRNA-ortholog-reconstruction

This repository contains the retrieve-fasta program to retrieve FASTA sequences from a BED12 file; a script to transform GFF3 features into BED12 lines and a script for retrieving full transcript orthologs from a list of ortholog splice sites of lncRNAs.

To build the ortholog splice sites, please consult the following publcation:
